AtliQ Hardware Sales Performance Analysis: Unlocking Growth Insights with Excel Power Tools

**📝 Project Summary:**
I completed a sales performance analysis project during the Codebasics Data Analytics Bootcamp **using Advanced Excel (Power Query, Power Pivot, Pivot Tables)**. The goal was to help AtliQ Hardware gain actionable insights from its 2019–2021 sales data.
 
**🔍 Problem Statement**
➡️ Identify top-selling products to prioritize inventory and marketing efforts.
➡️ Recognize top-performing customers to strengthen partnerships and drive loyalty.
➡️ Analyze YoY sales growth to understand market trends and operational efficiency.
➡️ Compare net sales vs. targets to uncover gaps and realign strategies for underperforming regions.

**📌 Key Insights:**
- Top Products: AQ Mx NB saw 5,723% growth; AQ Trigger Ms generated $17.9M in sales.
- Top Customers: Amazon ($82M) and Integration Stores (887% growth) led revenue.
Market Performance:
- India: Highest revenue ($161.26M), but -5.9% below target.
- Poland: Underperformed at -18.1% vs. target.
- Divisional Growth: PC Division up 413.7%, driving overall success.
 
**💡 Outcomes & Recommendations:**
✅ Scale high-performing products and strengthen top customer partnerships.
✅ Reassess strategies in underperforming regions (e.g., Poland).
✅ Invest in high-growth categories like PCs.
 
**🌟 Final Thoughts:**
This project sharpened my skills in data modeling, transformation, and business insight generation using Excel.

## Financial Project
**🚀Project title:**
AtliQ Hardware Financial Analysis Report: Unlocking Strategic Insights

**📝 Project Summary:**
I conducted a comprehensive financial analysis for AtliQ Hardware, leveraging **Advanced Excel (Power Query, Power Pivot, and Pivot Tables)** to dissect their 2019–2021 performance. The goal was to transform raw financial data into actionable insights that support strategic, data-driven decision-making.

**🔍 Problem Statement:**
AtliQ Hardware needed financial clarity on:
➡️ Profit & Loss by Country – Identify top-performing and underperforming markets.
➡️ P&L by Month & Fiscal Year – Uncover seasonal patterns and year-over-year trends.
➡️Gross Margin % by Quarter – Track profitability shifts across regions and timeframes.

**📈 Key Insights:**
- Regional Performance
Top Markets:
France (GM%: 43.3%), Japan (44.7%), New Zealand (45.0%)
These countries consistently delivered strong margins.
Challenges:
Germany (29.9%) and Austria (30.0%) underperformed, hinting at cost or pricing inefficiencies.

- Quarterly Trends
Strong Start, Weak Finish:
ANZ and ROA maintained ~42–44% GM in 2019 but declined to ~38% by 2021.
India's GM% Drop:
Fell from 42.4% in 2019 to 32.0% in 2021, likely due to rising COGS or market pressure.

- Monthly & Fiscal Year Analysis
Seasonality:
Q4 (Dec–Feb) consistently delivered peak revenue (e.g., $29.9M in Dec 2020).
Explosive Growth in 2021:
India: +224% net sales; China: +322% — but rising COGS (e.g., India’s COGS up 225%) reduced profitability.

**💡 Outcomes & Strategic Recommendations:**
✅ Double Down on High-Growth Markets
Capitalize on India's and China’s expansion, while tackling rising COGS to protect margins.
✅ Control Costs in Low-Margin Regions
Investigate pricing, logistics, and supplier contracts in Germany and Austria.
✅ Seasonal Planning
Align inventory and promotions with strong Q4 demand for revenue maximization.
✅ Recover Gross Margins
Focus on margin recovery strategies in ANZ/ROA through operational reviews and pricing optimization.

**🎯 Conclusion:**
This project demonstrated how financial analysis can uncover both opportunities and risks—crucial for effective business strategy. Looking forward to applying these skills to more data-to-insight challenges!
